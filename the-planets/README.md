# Project Overview

## Project Name
<h3>The Planets</h3>

## Project Description
<p>Vistors will be able to find information on the planets in our solar system. They also will be able to enter in new objects and have them render to the page. Space and the planets are a fascinating aspect to think about, but a lot of the time the information is very hard to understand. The goal of this app is to provide information in layman's terms to accommodate everyone. </p>

- Render a page showing all of the user submissions


### Post MVP

- Add delete option on user entries
- Add favorite button and save to local storage
- Use a second API to get more information on other object in space (planets, comets, asteroids, the sun, pictures of other galaxies, etc)
