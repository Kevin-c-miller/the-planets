## Project Name
<h3>The Planets</h3>

## Project Description
<p>Vistors will be able to search and find information on the planets in our solar system. Space and the planets are a fascinating aspect to think about, but a lot of the time the information is very hard to understand. The goal of this app is to provide information in layman's terms to accommodate everyone. </p>

## MVP
- Render a page showing all of the planets and a picture (coming from the airtable API)
- Render a page where a user will be able to enter a new record onto the page (other dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, the sun, etc)
- Render a page specifially for each planet displaying information about the planet (coming from the airtable API)


## Post MVP
- Use a second API to get more information on each planet and the solarsystem, such as planet moons and information about them, comets, asteroids
- Create a new table on airtable and have users vote on their favorite planet and display back that infromation in a chart/table/graph
