# Project Overview

## Project Name
<h3>The Planets</h3>

## Project Description
<p>Vistors will be able to find information on the planets in our solar system. They also will be able to enter in new objects and have them render to the page. Space and the planets are a fascinating aspect to think about, but a lot of the time the information is very hard to understand. The goal of this app is to provide information in layman's terms to accommodate everyone. </p>

### MVP
- Render a page showing all of the planets and a picture (coming from the airtable API)
- Render a page where a user will be able to enter a new record onto the page (other dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, the sun, etc)
- Render a page specifially for each planet displaying information about the planet (coming from the airtable API)


### Post MVP
- Use a second API to get more information on each planet and the solarsystem, such as planet moons and information about them, comets, asteroids
- Create a new table on airtable and have users vote on their favorite planet and display back that information in a chart/table/graph
